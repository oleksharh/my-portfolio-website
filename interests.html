            <h1 class="title-section">Programming</h1>
            <div class="text-section">
                <p>Programming has been a key part of my life and education, evolving from a curiosity to a passion for
                    problem-solving. I find great satisfaction in crafting solutions to complex challenges, whether it’s
                    designing efficient algorithms or debugging tricky issues. I focus on writing clean, readable code
                    that not only solves problems but is also easy to maintain and modify for future development. This
                    approach is central to my work across various projects and languages.</p>
                <p>I primarily work with Python, C++, and SQL, each of which I use in different contexts. Python is my
                    go-to for automation, data processing, and web scraping, while C++ serves me well for
                    performance-critical system-level programming. My experience with SQL has taught me to design
                    efficient database systems, and I enjoy the challenge of optimizing queries and managing data in
                    larger applications. These languages have helped me develop a versatile skillset, ready to tackle a
                    variety of programming tasks.</p>
                <p>What excites me most is the intersection of software and hardware. Through projects like my DIY
                    Stream Deck and various Arduino-based applications, I’ve gained hands-on experience working with
                    microcontrollers and sensors. This has deepened my understanding of both programming and
                    electronics, and I enjoy the challenge of creating software that interacts with the physical world.
                    Each project teaches me valuable lessons in troubleshooting, optimization, and debugging.</p>
                <p>Looking ahead, I’m eager to take on more complex challenges, collaborate with others, and continue
                    learning. Programming is a constantly evolving field, and I’m committed to staying current with new
                    technologies and frameworks. Ultimately, I aim to use my skills to create tools and systems that
                    make a real-world impact, solving practical problems and improving daily life.</p>

        <section class="modelling-section">
            <h1 class="title-section">3D Design and Modelling</h1>
            <div class="text-section">
                <p>I’ve always been drawn to the idea of building things from scratch, especially when it comes to
                    creating functional designs. This interest led me to explore 3D design and modelling, which has
                    become a central part of my hobbyist and academic projects. My go-to tool for 3D modelling is Fusion
                    360, a software that allows me to create precise models for projects, particularly in electronics.
                    Whether it’s designing a custom enclosure for a circuit board or a specialized tool for my
                    workspace, Fusion 360’s parametric design features provide the flexibility I need to bring my ideas
                    to life.</p>
                <p>In addition to Fusion 360, I use Blender for more artistic and creative models. It’s free and
                    incredibly powerful for creating detailed, organic shapes and textures, which is useful when I want
                    to work on complex, free-form models, such as a sculpture or an intricate design. The mesh-editing
                    capabilities in Blender allow me to manipulate models in ways that Fusion 360 doesn’t, making it
                    ideal for more creative projects.</p>
                <p>One of my favorite aspects of 3D design is how easily it transitions to 3D printing. After designing
                    a model, I can print it out to test the functionality of the design in the real world. This hands-on
                    approach lets me quickly iterate and make adjustments, learning from each iteration and refining the
                    design. I’ve created everything from custom enclosures for electronics to phone stands and cable
                    organizers, and I enjoy the challenge of making designs not only functional but also aesthetically
                    pleasing.</p>
                <p>By combining 3D design with 3D printing, I’ve been able to bridge the gap between the digital and
                    physical worlds. This process of creating something virtually and then seeing it come to life in the
                    real world is one of the most satisfying aspects of my work. As I continue to refine my skills, I
                    look forward to applying 3D design to larger-scale projects and further exploring the potential of
                    3D printing for both personal and professional use.</p>

        <section class="repairing-section">
            <h1 class="title-section">Hands-On Projects and Repair</h1>
            <div class="text-section">
                <p>I believe there’s great value in understanding how things work by getting my hands dirty and diving
                    into practical, hands-on projects. I’ve always enjoyed working on electronics, bikes, cars, and
                    other mechanical systems, which has taught me a lot about problem-solving, adaptability, and
                    creativity. This hands-on experience also helps me approach software development from a more
                    grounded perspective, as I often consider how the physical world interacts with the code I write.
                </p>
                <p>One of my favorite activities is repairing and improving electronics. Whether it’s fixing a broken
                    phone or upgrading an old computer, I find it fascinating to diagnose the problem, trace the fault,
                    and fix it. Working with microcontrollers, like the Arduino or ESP32, is a big part of this. I’ve
                    developed several projects where I integrate software with hardware to automate or enhance everyday
                    tasks. For instance, I designed a custom tool for my workspace that helps organize cables and tools
                    based on the specific needs of my projects. This tool involved both 3D design and electronics, so it
                    allowed me to combine several of my interests and skills into a single project. The process of
                    repairing and modifying electronics not only teaches me about hardware but also deepens my
                    understanding of how software interfaces with physical systems.</p>
                <p>Alongside electronics, I also enjoy working on bikes, cars, and other mechanical systems. In the
                    past, I’ve restored bicycles, tuned engines, and even worked on some automotive repairs. These tasks
                    require attention to detail, an understanding of mechanical systems, and the ability to troubleshoot
                    when things don’t go as planned. Over time, I’ve come to appreciate the precision and care needed to
                    keep things running smoothly. This hands-on experience has shaped the way I approach problem-solving
                    in software development. Much like when I’m working with electronics or mechanical systems, I often
                    take a step-by-step approach to debugging code, ensuring that I systematically test and address each
                    issue that arises..</p>
                <p>One thing I love about working on these kinds of projects is the satisfaction of solving real-world
                    problems. Whether it’s fixing a malfunctioning piece of equipment or designing a custom solution to
                    a problem, the ability to see the tangible results of my work is highly rewarding. These hands-on
                    projects have taught me how to approach challenges with patience, persistence, and creativity. They
                    have also pushed me to constantly learn and grow, as there’s always something new to explore,
                    whether it’s a new tool, technique, or technology.</p>
