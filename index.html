            <div class="text-section">
                <p>Hello! I'm Oleksandr Sharhorodskyi, a Computer Science student at the
                    University of Hertfordshire, currently studying for a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. I
                    enjoy
                    solving problems and creating solutions through code and design.
                    My studies have given me a solid understanding of programming, including Python, C++, and SQL, with
                    some
                    experience in Java, TypeScript, and C. I've performed well in courses like Advanced Computational
                    Problem Solving, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Introduction to Hardware and C Programming,
                    maintaining an average score of 86.6/100.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of academics, I work on projects to improve my technical skills. For instance, I am building
                    a
                    DIY Stream Deck with an ESP32 board that shows system data on a small screen and integrates
                    Bluetooth
                    functionality. Another project I’m working on is the Notify Me Telegram Bot, a Python-based tool
                    that
                    helps with task management and reminders.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I focus on both software and hardware. I’ve gained experience in low-level software development for
                    devices like Arduino and ESP32 boards and enjoy creating detailed 3D models with Fusion 360 for my
                    projects. My 3D printing and design work also include making practical household tools and
                    components.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I’m not working on tech, I enjoy cycling, fixing or improving mechanical systems like bikes and
                    vehicles, and experimenting with ways to make everyday tasks more efficient. These activities keep
                    me
                    curious and resourceful.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I’m always looking for opportunities to improve and collaborate. If you’re interested in my work,
                    feel
                    free to check out my GitHub or reach out to me on LinkedIn!
                </p>
